# STEDI Human Balance Analysis – AWS Glue Data Lake Project

## 📊 Overview

This project uses AWS Glue and other AWS services to build a serverless data lake pipeline for analyzing human balance sensor data from STEDI. The goal is to clean, transform, and prepare the data for future machine learning applications.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Clean and normalize raw data from sensors (Accelerometer, Customer, Step Trainer).
- Upload cleaned data to AWS S3 and catalog with AWS Glue Crawlers.
- Use AWS Glue Jobs (PySpark) to transform and join data for analysis.
- Reduce dataset intelligently to keep only relevant records.
- Document the issues faced and provide solutions.

## ⚙️ Tools & Services

- **AWS Glue** (Crawlers, Jobs, Catalog)
- **AWS S3** (Data Lake storage)
- **AWS Athena** (SQL Querying)
- **PySpark** (Data processing)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional for EDA)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Download and clean data**  
   - Fix formatting issues in CSVs.
   - Save cleaned files under `data/cleaned`.

2. **Upload to S3**  
   - Upload to the appropriate S3 bucket: `s3://your-bucket-name/cleaned/`

3. **Run AWS Glue Crawlers**  
   - One for each cleaned dataset to populate AWS Glue Data Catalog.

4. **Run Glue Jobs (ETL)**  
   - Use scripts from the `glue-scripts` directory.

5. **Query with Athena**  
   - Check the transformed data using SQL.
